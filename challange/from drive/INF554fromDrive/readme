The main file to be run is the jupyter notebook named GNN_INF554.ipynb.
It depends on the functions in the python files in the folder named "functions".
It is a neural network with convolution, so running it on a GPU is highly recommended,
and it is made such, that it can be run in Google Colab, so one can utillize the 
GPU there. 


Placement of data:
- training_labels.json should be placed in the same folder as GNN_INF554.ipynb, i.e.
  the outermost folder.
- test data should be placed in the folder "test"
- training data should be placed in the folder "training"
